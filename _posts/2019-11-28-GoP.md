# Summary 

During my undergrad I undertook a research internship with the Earthbyte Group where I got to model the quaternary evolution of the Gulf of Papua. This work evolved over the next year to also include reefs and carbonate growth. Using the modelling tool Badlands and a whole bunch of input files we created a surface process model over the last 2 million years.

Here are some animations where you can see erosion and deposition through time in the Gulf of Papua.
