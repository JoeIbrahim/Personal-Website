I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney looking to complete in 2023. My research looks at the dynamic evolution of fold-thrust belts, drawing from numerical models, fieldwork and microstructure. Beyond my musty office on campus you're likely to run into me on a run, in a climbing gym, or at the pub (I am a geologist after all!).
